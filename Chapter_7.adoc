== Chapter 7. Creating Graphical Calculator with JavaFX 

After lots of of code example producing boring outputs to the system console, it's time for creating a nice looking GUI. We're accustomed to programs that open a window with buttons, text fields, menus and the likes. 

Java has an old library of components called Swing, and the new one called JavaFX framework. We'll use only JavaFX in this book.

In this chapter I'll explain you the basics of GUI programming with JavaFX. You'll learn how to create GUI containers and arrange GUI components inside them. In the next chapter you'll learn how to write code that reacts on user's actions (a.k.a. events) like a click on the button or a mouse move. 

By the end of this chapter we'll create a GUI for the calculator that will look like this:

[[FIG7-1]]

This is just the GUI part. The working version of the calculator will be finished in Chapter 8.

=== Introduction to JavaFX

With JavaFX you can create Graphic User Interface in two ways:

* By writing the code in Java as you did in previous chapters.

* With the help of the visual layout tool called Scene Builder, where you'll be dragging and dropping components on the window and saving the design in the FXML format. Then the Java program will load this _.fxml_ file and display your creation.

I'll show you both ways, but let's start with some basics of development with JavaFX. Let's set the stage, because JavaFX uses theater terminology. 

IntelliJ IDEA will helps you to get stated quickly. Just  create a new project (the menu File | New Project), select JavaFX application as the project type and give a name. In a second a new project will be created with  Two Java classes `Main` and `Controller` and a file named _sample.fxml_ as shown below.

[[FIG7-2]]
.The newly generated IDEA project
image::images/fig_7_02.png[]

The `Main` class of a JavaFX application extends `Application` and is an entry point of your application. JavaFX classes are located in the packages `javafx.stage` and `javafx.scene`.The `main()` method invokes the method `launch()` from `Application`, which in turn will call the method `start()`. 
Then the program loads _sample.fxml_, sets the title of the stage and creates a `Scene` 300 by 275 pixels. 

A JavaFX application has to instantiate a `Stage` object first. Pretend that you're a play director and need to set up one or more scenes (views).  Each scene includes GUI nodes (containers and components).  These node can be instantiate either as Java classes or loaded from the `.fxml` file as it was done in the code generated by IDEA. The content of the generated _sample.fxml_ looks like this:

[source, xml]
----
<?import javafx.geometry.Insets?>
<?import javafx.scene.layout.GridPane?>

<?import javafx.scene.control.Button?>
<?import javafx.scene.control.Label?>
<GridPane fx:controller="sample.Controller"
          xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml" alignment="center" hgap="10" vgap="10">
</GridPane>
----

FXML is a markup languages based on XML (a popular data presentation format). The idea is to separate the creation of the GUI in a declarative language (FXML) from the application logic (Java). If we didn't use IDEA, the FXML would be generated by Scene Builder. In FXML the GUI is represented by tags located in angle brackets, e.g. `<GridPane>`. Each tag has a matching closing tag that start with a forward slash, e.g. `</GridPane>` and may have attributes (e.g. `alignment="center"`). The `<GridPane>` tag corresponds to the Java class `GrindPane`, which is one of the JavaFX layouts - I'll explain them shortly. Actually and FXML tag has a corresponding Java class.

The generated Java class `Controller` has just the pair of curly braces at this point, but we'll be writing the application logic there. Later on you'll connect the generated FXML views with the Java code of the controller. Run the `Main` program and it'll show an empty window that looks like this:

[[FIG7-3]]

=== Brief Overview of JavaFX Layouts 

Users of your application can have computers different screen sizes. JavaFX comes with _layouts_ that help with arranging GUI controls on the scene and keeping the arrangement for different stage sizes (think window sizes). There are following layout container classes (and similarly named FXML tags):

* HBox
* VBox
* FlowPane
* GridPane
* BorderPane
* StackPane
* TilePane
* AnchorPane

The `HBox` class (the horizontal box) places controls in a row next to each other. The vertical box `VBox` places controls vertically. The `FlowPane` places the nodes in a row and then wraps to the next row if there is no room in the current one.

The `GridPane` allows to arrange UI controls in rows and columns and assign constraints (properties) to each cell.

The `BorderPane` splits the scene into five regions, which are called `left`, `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `center`. 

The `TilePane` layout is similar to the FlowPane, but it places each node in a cell of the same size (like tiles on the wall). Say, you need to display several images in a tile layout. Adding the `ImageView` nodes to the `TilePane` will shows them as tiles next to each other. 

The `StackPane` layout works as a deck of playing cards - only one child node will be shown at a time covering the other nodes.

The `AnchorPane` lets you to anchor nodes at left, top, right, and bottom of the scene. Imagine a music player application with the buttons Rewind on the left and the Fast Forward on the right. The `AncorPane` allows to force the Rewind button to always remain at 20 pixel from the left border of the window and 10 pixels from the bottom even when the window resizes. For that you can use the `leftAnchor` and `bottomAnchor` properties. For example,

[source, java]
----
AnchorPane.setLeftAnchor(rewindBtn, 20);
AnchorPane.setBottomAnchor(rewindBtn, 10);
----

If you'd be writing the code manually in Java, you'd be going through the following steps with any layout:

1. Create instances of child nodes to be used within the layout container.

2. Create an instance of the selected layout class (e.g. `HBox`). This instance will serve as a container and a layout manager for all child nodes that you'll add to it.

3. Add the child nodes to the container using either the method `add()` or `addAll()`.

4. If this layout instance need to be used inside another layout (e.g. an `HBox` can be placed inside the `BorderPane`) add the instance created in Step 1 to the parent container by using the method `add()`.

But it's easier to create layouts and components using a visual tool, and this is what we'll do next.

=== Getting Started With Scene Builder

Scene Builder 2.0 is a visual layout tool for JavaFX applications by Oracle. Download it from http://goo.gl/9jOse6. Follow the http://goo.gl/rCt8x1[installation instructions] for your operational system and install Scene Builder on your computer. In this section I'll show you how to quickly get started with Scene Builder, but you should also watch this helpful https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHcnsEoSK_c[Youtube video].

You can start the Scene Builder either independently or from IDEA. For example, if you right-click on the _sample.fxml_ file in your newly generated IDEA project it'll show you a popup menu, which includes the item Open in SceneBuilder. Select this item. The very first time IDEA will ask you to confirm  the location of Scene Builder application on your computer. Then it'll open _sample.fxml_ in Scene Builder. This is how it looks on my computer:

[[FIG7-4]]
.Scene Builder with opened sample.fxml
image::images/fig_7_04.png[]

On the left panel you can select containers, controls, menus, shapes and drag and drop them in the middle panel. Not the GridPanel layout shown at the bottom left - the arrangement of GUI components inside of this scene will be controlled by `GridLayout`. Let me select the Button from the Controls section on the left and drop it in the middle. The Screen Builder's window will look like this:

[[FIG7-5]]
.Adding a button to the scene
image::images/fig_7_05.png[]

The right panel allows you to change the properties of this button. These little boxes with the digit one represent so called row and column constraints - we'll discuss them shortly.

The menu Preview | Show Preview in Window will show how your GUI will look during the right time. So far our one-button screen is not too fancy, and this is how it's preview looks like:

[[FIG7-6]]
.Scene Builder: previewing in window
image::images/fig_7_06.png[]

Let's save the changes in _sample.fxml_ (menu File | Save) and open this file in IDEA. There were no content between `<GridPanel>` and `</GridPanel>`in the generated _sample.fxml_, but now there is:

[source, xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<?import javafx.scene.control.*?>
<?import java.lang.*?>
<?import javafx.scene.layout.*?>
<?import javafx.geometry.Insets?>
<?import javafx.scene.layout.GridPane?>
<?import javafx.scene.control.Button?>
<?import javafx.scene.control.Label?>

<GridPane alignment="center" hgap="10" vgap="10" xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml/1" xmlns="http://javafx.com/javafx/8" fx:controller="sample.Controller">
   <columnConstraints>
      <ColumnConstraints />
      <ColumnConstraints />
   </columnConstraints>
   <rowConstraints>
      <RowConstraints />
      <RowConstraints />
   </rowConstraints>
   <children>
      <Button mnemonicParsing="false" text="Button" 
         GridPane.columnIndex="1" GridPane.rowIndex="1" />
   </children>
</GridPane>
----

I'll go through the details of the `GridPane` layout in the next section, but please note that Scene Builder created some tags to specify the constraints for the rows and columns of the grid. The `Button` component is placed inside the grid in the cell located in the intersection of the column 1 and row 1. 


=== GridPane Layout

I'm not going to cover each JavaFX layout in details, but will show you how to use a pretty powerful layout - `GridPane`. When we'll work on the GUI for the calculator, I'll also show you how to design a scene using a combination of layouts.

GridPane divides the area into rows and columns and places GUI components (the nodes) into the grid cells. With `GridPane` layout cells don't have to have the same size - nodes can span. If the screen size changes, the content won't be rearranged and will maintain the grid look. 

Before placing the node into a cell you have to specify grid constraints such as `rowIndex` and `columnIndex` (the coordinate of the cell, which starts with 0,0). The `rowSpans` and `columnSpan` allow to make the cell as wide (or as tall) as several other cells. The `GridPane` http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/layout/GridPane.html[documentation] describes lots of various constraints that can define the behavior of each cell's content if the windows gets resized. I'll show you a basic example that uses some of these constraints.

I want to create a Login window where the user can enter the id, password and press the button Sign In. The scene will use `GridPane` layout. The first row will contain a `Label` and `TextField` for user id, the second row will have a similar pair for the password, and the third row of the grid will have one `Button` Sign In that should span two columns. This is how this window should look like:

[[FIG7-7]]
.Sign In GUI
image::images/fig_7_07.png[]

I'll start with creating a new IDEA JavaFX project (menus File | New Project |JavaFX Application)giving it a name Signin. The project with classes `Main`, `Controller` and the file _sample.fxml_ will be generated. Let's rename this FXML file into _signin.fxml_. IDEA will automatically change the corresponding line in the `Main` class to load this file instead of _sample.fxml_:

[source, java]
----
Parent root = FXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource("signin.fxml"));
----

Rename the package from _sample_ to _signin_ (right-click menu, Refactor | Rename). Now open the file signin.fxml in Scene Builder and start thinking about laying out the components of our Sign In scene. Let's take another look at the image of the Sign In window. I can clearly see that GUI component are placed in three rows. The first two have a `Label` and `TextField` and the third one has a `Button`.  

I can also recognize two columns in the layout of the Sign In window. The first column has two `Label` components and the left side of the `Button`. The second column has two `TextFiled` components and the right size of the `Button`. We can also say that the `Button` _spans_ two columns. We've got a 2x3 grid!

Open the generated `signin.fxml` in Scene Builder. Since this file has already empty `<GrigPane>` tag, you'll see GridPane(0,0) as the root of the hierarchy in the bottom left corner as in Figure 4 above. So far this grid has zero rows and zero columns. Right-click in the middle of the screen and add three rows and two columns to the grid using the menus Add Row Below and Add Column After. When the GridPane is selected The Scene Builder's window may look similar to this:

[[FIG7-8]]
.A GridPane (2,3)
image::images/fig_7_08.png[]

Now let's drag from the Controls section on the left two `Label` controls and a `Button` and drop them into the appropriate cells in the first grid column. Change the text on these component to be UserID:, Password, and Sign In.
Then we could drag and drop two `TextField` objects in the top two cells in the second column. Actually, it's not a good idea to enter password in the clear text. I'll use the `TextField` for the user ID, and the `PasswordField` (it marks user's input) for password.

[[FIG7-9]]
.A GridPane with nodes in Scene Builder
image::images/fig_7_09.png[]

Note that the hierarchy of nodes is shown in the bottom left corner. On complex GUI layout it might be easier to select the GUI control in the Hierarchy panel than in the design area in the middle. Now select the menu Preview | Show Preview in Window and you'll see the following window:

[[FIG7-10]]
.Previwing in Scene Builder
image::images/fig_7_10.png[]

This window doesn't look exactly as we wanted, there are some issues with alignments, there is no spacing between the container and components, and the button Sign In doesn't span. But on the bright side, the `GridPane` controls the layout and if you'll try to stretch this window, GUI components won't change their relative positioning:

[[FIG7-11]]
.Streching the preview window in Scene Builder
image::images/fig_7_11.png[]

Let's do a couple of more property changes before we'll run this application from IDEA. The properties panel is located on the right and has three sections: Properties, Layout, and Code, and you'll find the properties to be change in n of these sections. 

1. On the left panel of Scene Builder select the `GridPane` and on the right panel change alignment to be TOP_LEFT.

2. Enter 10 for the padding on top, right, bottom and left for the `GridPane`. We need some spacing between the borders of the scene and the grid.

3. Select the `Button` on the left and then change the column span to be 2 and the preferred width to be a large number, say 300. This will make the button wide.  

4. Select the first column of the grid row by clicking on the little 0 on top of the grid. Set the both preferred and maximum width for this column to be 70.

5. Select the second column of the grid row by clicking on the little 1 on top of the grid. Set the both preferred and maximum width for this column to be 100.

After you do all these changes and save them, the file `signin.fxml` will look like this:

[source, xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<?import javafx.geometry.*?>
<?import javafx.scene.control.*?>
<?import java.lang.*?>
<?import javafx.scene.layout.*?>
<?import javafx.geometry.Insets?>
<?import javafx.scene.layout.GridPane?>
<?import javafx.scene.control.Button?>
<?import javafx.scene.control.Label?>

<GridPane hgap="10" vgap="10" xmlns="http://javafx.com/javafx/8" xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml/1" fx:controller="signin.Controller">
   <rowConstraints>
      <RowConstraints minHeight="10.0" prefHeight="30.0" />
      <RowConstraints minHeight="10.0" prefHeight="30.0" />
      <RowConstraints minHeight="10.0" prefHeight="30.0" />
   </rowConstraints>
   <columnConstraints>
      <ColumnConstraints maxWidth="70.0" minWidth="10.0" prefWidth="70.0" />
      <ColumnConstraints maxWidth="100.0" minWidth="10.0" prefWidth="100.0" />
   </columnConstraints>
   <children>
      <Label alignment="CENTER" text="User ID:" />
      <Label text="Password:" GridPane.rowIndex="1" />
      <Button mnemonicParsing="false" prefWidth="300.0" text="Sign In" GridPane.columnSpan="2" GridPane.rowIndex="2" />
      <TextField GridPane.columnIndex="1" />
      <PasswordField GridPane.columnIndex="1" GridPane.rowIndex="1" />
   </children>
   <padding>
      <Insets bottom="10.0" left="10.0" right="10.0" top="10.0" />
   </padding>
</GridPane>
----

This is a declarative way of creating GUI in FXML. No Java coding was required to create the GUI for this application.

Finally, let's set the size of the stage so it can accommodate our scene. In IDEA, open the class `Main` and the code set the size of the scene to be 400x250 pixels.

[source, java]
----
primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(root, 400, 250));
----

Run the `Main` program and you'll see the window that looks like in Figure 7 above. The work that we've done in Scene Builder was a little tedious, but it didn't require any knowledge of Java. This means that this work can be given to a UI designer, while you'll concentrate on programming the application logic in Java. 


=== Styling with CSS

Each node can be styled using the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file. CSS are widely used for styling Web applications. On the top of the scene graph you'll create a root node. 

 In addition to built in layouts you can customize the positioning of the nodes on the scene using CSS.
