== Chapter 7. Introduction to GUI with JavaFX 

After lots of code samples producing outputs to the system console, it's time for creating a nice looking Graphic User Interface (GUI). We're accustomed to programs that open windows with buttons, text fields, menus and other GUI components. 

Java has an old library of GUI components called http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/[Swing], and the new one called http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/get_started/jfxpub-get_started.htm[JavaFX]. We'll use only JavaFX in this book.

In this chapter I'll explain you the basics of GUI programming with JavaFX. You'll learn how to create GUI containers and arrange GUI components inside them. In the next chapter you'll learn how to write code that reacts on user's actions (a.k.a. events) like a click on the button or a mouse move. 

By the end of this chapter you should be ready to work on the following assignment: "Create the GUI for a calculator that will look similar to the calculator that comes with MAC OS":

=== Introduction to JavaFX

With JavaFX you can create Graphic User Interface in two ways:

* By writing the code in Java as you did in previous chapters.

* With the help of the visual layout tool called Scene Builder, where you'll be dragging and dropping components on the window and saving the design in the FXML format. Then the Java program will load this _.fxml_ file and display your creation.

I'll show you both ways, but let's start with some basics of development with JavaFX. Let's set the stage, because JavaFX uses theater terminology. 

IntelliJ IDEA will helps you to get stated quickly. Just  create a new project (the menu File | New Project), select JavaFX application as the project type and give a name. In a second a new project will be created with  Two Java classes `Main` and `Controller` and a file named _sample.fxml_ as shown below.

[[FIG7-2]]
.The newly generated IDEA project
image::images/fig_7_02.png[]

The `Main` class of a JavaFX application extends `Application` and is an entry point of your application. JavaFX classes are located in the packages `javafx.stage` and `javafx.scene`.The `main()` method invokes the method `launch()` from `Application`, which in turn will call the method `start()`. 
Then the program loads _sample.fxml_, sets the title of the stage and creates a `Scene` 300 by 275 pixels. 

A JavaFX application has to instantiate a `Stage` object first. Pretend that you're a play director and need to set up one or more scenes (views).  Each scene includes GUI nodes (containers and components).  These node can be instantiate either as Java classes or loaded from the `.fxml` file as it was done in the code generated by IDEA. The content of the generated _sample.fxml_ looks like this:

[source, xml]
----
<?import javafx.geometry.Insets?>
<?import javafx.scene.layout.GridPane?>

<?import javafx.scene.control.Button?>
<?import javafx.scene.control.Label?>
<GridPane fx:controller="sample.Controller"
          xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml" alignment="center" hgap="10" vgap="10">
</GridPane>
----

FXML is a markup languages based on XML (a popular data presentation format). The idea is to separate the creation of the GUI in a declarative language (FXML) from the application logic (Java). If we didn't use IDEA, the FXML would be generated by Scene Builder. In FXML the GUI is represented by tags located in angle brackets, e.g. `<GridPane>`. Each tag has a matching closing tag that start with a forward slash, e.g. `</GridPane>` and may have attributes (e.g. `alignment="center"`). The `<GridPane>` tag corresponds to the Java class `GrindPane`, which is one of the JavaFX layouts - I'll explain them shortly. Actually and FXML tag has a corresponding Java class.

The generated Java class `Controller` has just the pair of curly braces at this point, but we'll be writing the application logic there. Later on you'll connect the generated FXML views with the Java code of the controller. Run the `Main` program and it'll show an empty window that looks like this:

[[FIG7-3]]
.Running the generated application
image::images/fig_7_03.png[]

=== Brief Overview of JavaFX Layouts 

Users of your application can have computers different screen sizes. JavaFX comes with _layouts_ that help with arranging GUI controls on the scene and keeping the arrangement for different stage sizes (think window sizes). There are following layout container classes (and similarly named FXML tags):

* HBox
* VBox
* FlowPane
* GridPane
* BorderPane
* StackPane
* TilePane
* AnchorPane

The `HBox` class (the horizontal box) places controls in a row next to each other. The vertical box `VBox` places controls vertically. The `FlowPane` places the nodes in a row and then wraps to the next row if there is no room in the current one.

The `GridPane` allows to arrange UI controls in rows and columns and assign constraints (properties) to each cell.

The `BorderPane` splits the scene into five regions, which are called `left`, `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `center`. 

The `TilePane` layout is similar to the FlowPane, but it places each node in a cell of the same size (like tiles on the wall). Say, you need to display several images in a tile layout. Adding the `ImageView` nodes to the `TilePane` will shows them as tiles next to each other. 

The `StackPane` layout works as a deck of playing cards - only one child node will be shown at a time covering the other nodes.

The `AnchorPane` lets you to anchor nodes at left, top, right, and bottom of the scene. Imagine a music player application with the buttons Rewind on the left and the Fast Forward on the right. The `AncorPane` allows to force the Rewind button to always remain at 20 pixel from the left border of the window and 10 pixels from the bottom even when the window resizes. For that you can use the `leftAnchor` and `bottomAnchor` properties. For example,

[source, java]
----
AnchorPane.setLeftAnchor(rewindBtn, 20);
AnchorPane.setBottomAnchor(rewindBtn, 10);
----

If you'd be writing the code manually in Java, you'd be going through the following steps with any layout:

1. Create instances of child nodes to be used within the layout container.

2. Create an instance of the selected layout class (e.g. `HBox`). This instance will serve as a container and a layout manager for all child nodes that you'll add to it.

3. Add the child nodes to the container using either the method `add()` or `addAll()`.

4. If this layout instance need to be used inside another layout (e.g. an `HBox` can be placed inside the `BorderPane`) add the instance created in Step 1 to the parent container by using the method `add()`.

But it's easier to create layouts and components using a visual tool, and this is what we'll do next.

=== Getting Started With Scene Builder

Scene Builder 2.0 is a visual layout tool for JavaFX applications by Oracle. Download it from http://goo.gl/9jOse6. Follow the http://goo.gl/rCt8x1[installation instructions] for your operational system and install Scene Builder on your computer. In this section I'll show you how to quickly get started with Scene Builder, but you should also watch this helpful https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHcnsEoSK_c[Youtube video].

You can start the Scene Builder either independently or from IDEA. For example, if you right-click on the _sample.fxml_ file in your newly generated IDEA project it'll show you a popup menu, which includes the item Open in SceneBuilder. Select this item. The very first time IDEA will ask you to confirm  the location of Scene Builder application on your computer. Then it'll open _sample.fxml_ in Scene Builder. This is how it looks on my computer:

[[FIG7-4]]
.Scene Builder with opened sample.fxml
image::images/fig_7_04.png[]

On the left panel you can select containers, controls, menus, shapes and drag and drop them in the middle panel. Not the GridPanel layout shown at the bottom left - the arrangement of GUI components inside of this scene will be controlled by `GridLayout`. Let me select the Button from the Controls section on the left and drop it in the middle. The Screen Builder's window will look like this:

[[FIG7-5]]
.Adding a button to the scene
image::images/fig_7_05.png[]

The right panel allows you to change the properties of this button. These little boxes with the digit one represent so called row and column constraints - we'll discuss them shortly.

The menu Preview | Show Preview in Window will show how your GUI will look during the right time. So far our one-button screen is not too fancy, and this is how it's preview looks like:

[[FIG7-6]]
.Scene Builder: previewing in window
image::images/fig_7_06.png[]

Let's save the changes in _sample.fxml_ (menu File | Save) and open this file in IDEA. There were no content between `<GridPanel>` and `</GridPanel>`in the generated _sample.fxml_, but now there is:

[source, xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<?import javafx.scene.control.*?>
<?import java.lang.*?>
<?import javafx.scene.layout.*?>
<?import javafx.geometry.Insets?>
<?import javafx.scene.layout.GridPane?>
<?import javafx.scene.control.Button?>
<?import javafx.scene.control.Label?>

<GridPane alignment="center" hgap="10" vgap="10" xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml/1" xmlns="http://javafx.com/javafx/8" fx:controller="sample.Controller">
   <columnConstraints>
      <ColumnConstraints />
      <ColumnConstraints />
   </columnConstraints>
   <rowConstraints>
      <RowConstraints />
      <RowConstraints />
   </rowConstraints>
   <children>
      <Button mnemonicParsing="false" text="Button" 
         GridPane.columnIndex="1" GridPane.rowIndex="1" />
   </children>
</GridPane>
----

I'll go through the details of the `GridPane` layout in the next section, but please note that Scene Builder created some tags to specify the constraints for the rows and columns of the grid. The `Button` component is placed inside the grid in the cell located in the intersection of the column 1 and row 1. 


=== GridPane Layout

I'm not going to cover each JavaFX layout in details, but will show you how to use a pretty powerful layout - `GridPane`. When we'll work on the GUI for the calculator, I'll also show you how to design a scene using a combination of layouts.

GridPane divides the area into rows and columns and places GUI components (the nodes) into the grid cells. With `GridPane` layout cells don't have to have the same size - nodes can span. If the screen size changes, the content won't be rearranged and will maintain the grid look. 

Before placing the node into a cell you have to specify grid constraints such as `rowIndex` and `columnIndex` (the coordinate of the cell, which starts with 0,0). The `rowSpans` and `columnSpan` allow to make the cell as wide (or as tall) as several other cells. The `GridPane` http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/layout/GridPane.html[documentation] describes lots of various constraints that can define the behavior of each cell's content if the windows gets resized. I'll show you a basic example that uses some of these constraints.

==== Designing a Sign In Window in Scene Builder

I want to create a Sign In window where the user can enter the id, password and press the button Sign In. The scene will use `GridPane` layout. The first row will contain a `Label` and `TextField` for user id, the second row will have a similar pair for the password, and the third row of the grid will have one `Button` Sign In that should span two columns. This is how this window should look like:

[[FIG7-7]]
.The Sign In Window
image::images/fig_7_07.png[]

I'll start with creating a new IDEA JavaFX project (menus File | New Project |JavaFX Application)giving it a name Signin. The project with classes `Main`, `Controller` and the file _sample.fxml_ will be generated. Let's rename this FXML file into _signin.fxml_. IDEA will automatically change the corresponding line in the `Main` class to load this file instead of _sample.fxml_:

[source, java]
----
Parent root = FXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource("signin.fxml"));
----

Rename the package from _sample_ to _signin_ (right-click menu, Refactor | Rename). Now open the file signin.fxml in Scene Builder and start thinking about laying out the components of our Sign In scene. Let's take another look at the image of the Sign In window. I can clearly see that GUI component are placed in three rows. The first two have a `Label` and `TextField` and the third one has a `Button`.  

I can also recognize two columns in the layout of the Sign In window. The first column has two `Label` components and the left side of the `Button`. The second column has two `TextFiled` components and the right size of the `Button`. We can also say that the `Button` _spans_ two columns. We've got a 2x3 grid!

Open the generated `signin.fxml` in Scene Builder. Since this file has already empty `<GrigPane>` tag, you'll see GridPane(0,0) as the root of the hierarchy in the bottom left corner as in Figure 4 above. So far this grid has zero rows and zero columns. Right-click in the middle of the screen and add three rows and two columns to the grid using the menus Add Row Below and Add Column After. When the GridPane is selected The Scene Builder's window may look similar to this:

[[FIG7-8]]
.A GridPane (2,3)
image::images/fig_7_08.png[]

Now let's drag from the Controls section on the left two `Label` controls and a `Button` and drop them into the appropriate cells in the first grid column. Change the text on these component to be UserID:, Password, and Sign In.
Then we could drag and drop two `TextField` objects in the top two cells in the second column. Actually, it's not a good idea to enter password in the clear text. I'll use the `TextField` for the user ID, and the `PasswordField` (it marks user's input) for password.

[[FIG7-9]]
.A GridPane with nodes in Scene Builder
image::images/fig_7_09.png[]

Note that the hierarchy of nodes is shown in the bottom left corner. On complex GUI layout it might be easier to select the GUI control in the Hierarchy panel than in the design area in the middle. Now select the menu Preview | Show Preview in Window and you'll see the following window:

[[FIG7-10]]
.Previwing in Scene Builder
image::images/fig_7_10.png[]

This window doesn't look exactly as we wanted, there are some issues with alignments, there is no spacing between the container and components, and the button Sign In doesn't span. But on the bright side, the `GridPane` controls the layout and if you'll try to stretch this window, GUI components won't change their relative positioning:

[[FIG7-11]]
.Streching the preview window in Scene Builder
image::images/fig_7_11.png[]

Let's do a couple of more property changes before we'll run this application from IDEA. The properties panel is located on the right and has three sections: Properties, Layout, and Code, and you'll find the properties to be change in n of these sections. 

1. On the left panel of Scene Builder select the `GridPane` and on the right panel change alignment to be TOP_LEFT.

2. Enter 10 for the padding on top, right, bottom and left for the `GridPane`. We need some spacing between the borders of the scene and the grid.

3. Select the `Button` on the left and then change the column span to be 2 and the preferred width to be a large number, say 300. This will make the button wide.  

4. Select the first column of the grid row by clicking on the little 0 on top of the grid. Set the both preferred and maximum width for this column to be 70.

5. Select the second column of the grid row by clicking on the little 1 on top of the grid. Set the both preferred and maximum width for this column to be 100.

After you do all these changes and save them, the file `signin.fxml` will look like this:

[source, xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<?import javafx.geometry.*?>
<?import javafx.scene.control.*?>
<?import java.lang.*?>
<?import javafx.scene.layout.*?>
<?import javafx.geometry.Insets?>
<?import javafx.scene.layout.GridPane?>
<?import javafx.scene.control.Button?>
<?import javafx.scene.control.Label?>

<GridPane hgap="10" vgap="10" xmlns="http://javafx.com/javafx/8" xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml/1" fx:controller="signin.Controller">
   <rowConstraints>
      <RowConstraints minHeight="10.0" prefHeight="30.0" />
      <RowConstraints minHeight="10.0" prefHeight="30.0" />
      <RowConstraints minHeight="10.0" prefHeight="30.0" />
   </rowConstraints>
   <columnConstraints>
      <ColumnConstraints maxWidth="70.0" minWidth="10.0" prefWidth="70.0" />
      <ColumnConstraints maxWidth="100.0" minWidth="10.0" prefWidth="100.0" />
   </columnConstraints>
   <children>
      <Label alignment="CENTER" text="User ID:" />
      <Label text="Password:" GridPane.rowIndex="1" />
      <Button mnemonicParsing="false" prefWidth="300.0" text="Sign In" GridPane.columnSpan="2" GridPane.rowIndex="2" />
      <TextField GridPane.columnIndex="1" />
      <PasswordField GridPane.columnIndex="1" GridPane.rowIndex="1" />
   </children>
   <padding>
      <Insets bottom="10.0" left="10.0" right="10.0" top="10.0" />
   </padding>
</GridPane>
----

This is a declarative way of creating GUI in FXML. No Java coding was required to create the GUI for this application.

Finally, let's set the size of the stage so it can accommodate our scene. In IDEA, open the class `Main` and the code set the size of the scene to be 200x150 pixels.

[source, java]
----
primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(root, 200, 150));
----

Run the `Main` program and you'll see the window that looks like in Figure 7 above. The work that we've done in Scene Builder was a little tedious, but it didn't require any knowledge of Java. This means that this work can be given to a UI designer, while you'll concentrate on programming the application logic in Java. 

==== Programming the Sign In Window in Java

Some people like visual design tools, but others don't. If you prefer to program everything in Java without using Scene Builder and FXML, you can certainly do it. Below is the Java code of the Sign In window that I've written in Java. It'll produce the same output as in Figure 7.

[source, java]
----
public class GridPaneSample extends Application {

  public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
      
      final int TWO_COLUMN_SPAN = 2; 
      
      Label userIdLbl = new Label("User ID:");
      TextField userIdTxt = new TextField();
      Label userPwdLbl = new Label("Password:");
      PasswordField userPwdTxt = new PasswordField();

      GridPane root = new GridPane();
      root.setVgap(10);
      root.setPadding(new Insets(10));
      root.setAlignment(Pos.CENTER);
      
      // Using static methods for setting node constraints 
      GridPane.setConstraints(userIdLbl, 0, 0);
      GridPane.setConstraints(userIdTxt, 1, 0);
      GridPane.setConstraints(userPwdLbl, 0, 1);
      GridPane.setConstraints(userPwdTxt, 1, 1);

      root.getChildren().addAll(userIdLbl, userIdTxt, 
                                userPwdLbl, userPwdTxt);
      
      Button signInBtn = new Button ("Sign In");
      
      // Allow the button to be wider overriding preferred width       
      signInBtn.setPrefWidth(Double.MAX_VALUE);
 
      // using instance method for directly adding the node
      root.add(signInBtn,0,2,TWO_COLUMN_SPAN,1); 
  
      Scene scene = new Scene(root,250,150);
      primaryStage.setScene(scene);
      primaryStage.show();
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
      launch(args);
  }
}
----

After all your efforts in Scene Builder, this Java program shouldn't be difficult for you to understand. As you see, there are classes named similarly to FXML tags. FXML tags can have attributes (e.g. `vgap="10" `), and in Java you'd need to call the corresponding setter (e.g. `root.setVgap(10)`). So the choice is yours - FXML or Java. If you have _visual personality_ use FXML, otherwise use Java.

=== Styling With CSS

It would be boring if all applications would look the same. Application windows may have different colors, fonts, buttons with rounded corners or use special visual effects. In other words, applications have different styles. Even though you can style JavaFX GUI components programmatically (e.g. by calling methods `setFont()` or `setFill()`) separating styling from programming allows professional UI designers to take care of the look and feel while software developers implement application logic. 

Separating the work of programmers and designers became  popular in Web applications. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a special language for styling UI. Styles of GUI components are stored in separate _.css_ files and are loaded and applied to components by the application's code. Sometimes this process is called _skinning_ - you can create an application that can "wear different skins" changing its look to the user's liking.  

Covering CSS in detail would require a separate book, but I'll show you a simple example of how the look of the GUI can be changed without the need to modify the Java code. 

You can either create so-called _CSS selectors_ to style a specific GUI component, a type of components (e.g. all buttons), or create a reusable style that can be applied programmatically to a selected component. 

To style a specific component it has to have a unique id. If you program GUI in Java, set in your Java code using the method `setId()`, for example:

[source,java]
----
Button signInBtn = new Button ("Sign In");
signInBtn.setId("submitBtn"); 
----

In FXML just add an `id` attribute to the tag of the component:

[source,xml]
----
<Button id="submitBtn" text="Sign In"> 
----

For a button with an id `submitBtn` you can add the following section to the CSS file to make its background color red:

[source, css]
----
#submitBtn{
  -fx-background-color: red;
}
----

You can find the names of the main CSS colors http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colornames.asp[online]. In CSS the id type selectors start with the #-sign as in `#submitBtn`. 

If you want to apply a style to several components of the same type, you need to define a type selector. For example, to make the text of all `Label` components red, you can define the following CSS type selector:

[source, xml]
----
.label{
  -fx-text-fill: red;
} 
----

Note that CSS type selectors start with the dot. To create a _CSS class selector_ that can be applied to any component, define under the selector under an arbitrary name and apply it programmatically to the components of your choice.  For example, you can specify the following class selector:

[source, xml]
----
.bluelabel{
   -fx-text-fill: blue;
   -fx-font-family:verdana;
   -fx-font-style:italic;
}
----

This class selector defines the rules that will display text of the component in blue *bold* verdana font in _italic_ style. Typically, you'll be loading the entire CSS file when the application starts so all styles are available for use. If you use Java for GUI programming, you can apply a class selector to a specific button just like this:

[source, java]
----
Label userPwdLbl = new Label("Password:");
userPwdLbl.getStyleClass().add("bluelabel");
----

In FXML assigning a CSS class selector is done by adding the attribute `styleClass` to the tag element:

[source, xml]
----
<Label text="Password:" styleClass="bluelabel" GridPane.rowIndex="1" />
----

You may ask, "How am I supposed to know which style properties are available for a given JavaFX component?" All JavaFX styles are described in the online document titled http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/doc-files/cssref.html["JavaFX CSS Reference Guide"].  

Let's learn apply all these styling techniques to the Sign In window from the previous section. In IDEA Signin project create a new file _signin.css_ with the following content:

[source, css]
----
#submitBtn{
    -fx-background-color: lightskyblue;
    -fx-font-family:verdana;
    -fx-font-size:20;
    -fx-font-weight: bold;
    -fx-stroke:navy;
    -fx-font-style:italic;
    -fx-border-radius: 20;
    -fx-background-radius: 20;
    -fx-padding: 5;
}

.label{
    -fx-text-fill: red;
}    

.bluelabel{
   -fx-text-fill: blue;
   -fx-font-family:verdana;
   -fx-font-style:italic;
}
----

This file defines three styles:

* an id selector for the component with the id `submitBtn`
* a type selector for all `Label` components
* a class selector `bluelabel` that we can be applied to certain labels.

To apply this CSS file to our Sign In application add the attribute `id="submitBtn"` to the `<Button>` element in _signin.fxml_.

The add the attribute `styleClass="bluelabel"` to the `<Password>` tag in `signin.fxml`.

Finally, in `Main.java` load the `signin.css` and apply it to the scene. The new version of `Main.java` will look like this:

[source, java]
----
public class Main extends Application {

  @Override
  public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception{
        Parent root = FXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource("signin.fxml"));
      primaryStage.setTitle("Sign In");

      Scene scene  = new Scene(root, 200, 150);
        scene.getStylesheets().add(getClass()
              .getResource("signin.css").toExternalForm());

      primaryStage.setScene(scene);
      primaryStage.show();
    }


  public static void main(String[] args) {
      launch(args);
  }
}
----

Run the `Main` application and you'll see a differently styled Sign In window: 

[[FIG7-12]]
.Styled Sign In Window
image::images/fig_7_12.png[]

When the application loads our CSS file it see that all labels must be red because of the type selector for labels. But then the application notices that the style for the `Label` Password was overriden by `styleClass="bluelabel"`, so it paints the text _Password_ in blue. 

=== BorderPane and Combining Layouts

Pretty often you see applications that split the window into several distinct areas - the header goes on top, the navigation bar is on the left (or right), the footer's at the bottom of the page and a large content area occupies the middle portion of the window. The `BorderPane` layout allows you to do exactly this - split the scene into up to five regions called `left`, `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `center`. 

Each of these regions can contain either a single GUI component or a container that will have "children" - components allocated in their own container, e.g. inside a `GridPane`. You'll use `BorderPane` layout with a nested `GridPane` while working on the calculator following instructions from the Challenge Yourself" section. Meanwhile, let's create a very basic window illustrating how the `BorderPane` layout works.

Open Scene Builder and create a new FXML file by selecting the menu File | New. Then drag `BorderPane` from the left and drop in the middle. Click on the `BorderPane` and you'll see a screen that can look as follows:

[[FIG7-13]]
.An Empty BorderPane
image::images/fig_7_13.png[]

Now select Insert TOP at the bottom left, and then drag add drop a `Label` from the Controls section on the onto the middle section of Screen Builder. Set the label's title "This is the Header". This text will be displayed at the top.

Now select Insert LEFT and then drag and drop `VBox` from the Containers area to the left side of the middle section of the Screen Builder. The `VBox` is a container for arranging GUI components vertically, which is what we need for creating a navigation menu. You'll see an empty gray area on the left.

[[FIG7-14]]
.Adding a VBox for navigation 
image::images/fig_7_14.png[]

Now select `VBOX` at the bottom left and add a couple of menu items to the empty `VBox`. Drag a `Button` from the Controls section and drop it onto the `VBox`. Change its text to read "Menu 1", and make it a little wider so it fits the `VBox` nicely. Add two more buttons labeled "Menu 2" and "Menu 3".

[[FIG7-15]]
.Adding buttons to VBox 
image::images/fig_7_15.png[]

Let's add a footer to the window now. Select Insert BOTTOM at the bottom left and then drag the `HBox` from the Containers area to the middle section. It'll look like a gray area at the bottom. Adjust its height so the footer doesn't take too much real estate in our scene. Now add three `Hyperlink` components from the Contols section to the footer and set their text to "Link 1", "Link 2", and "Link 3" correspondingly. The Scene Builder's window should look like this: 

[[FIG7-16]]

Select the menu Preview | Show Preview in Window will help you to see how the window will look during the runtime:

Of course, this window may need more work on styling controls and adjusting sizes and alignments, but as long as you understand how to lay out a scene, the shouldn't be too difficult. Creating and applying CSS styles can may this windows a lot prettier.

Using Scene Builder's menu File | Save save the layout in a file _border.fxml_. If you open this file in any text editor, its content may look similar to this:

[source, xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<?import javafx.scene.image.*?>
<?import javafx.scene.control.*?>
<?import java.lang.*?>
<?import javafx.scene.layout.*?>

<BorderPane maxHeight="-Infinity" maxWidth="-Infinity" minHeight="-Infinity" minWidth="-Infinity" prefHeight="400.0" prefWidth="600.0" xmlns="http://javafx.com/javafx/8" xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml/1">
   <top>
      <Label text="This is the Header" BorderPane.alignment="CENTER" />
   </top>
   <left>
      <VBox prefHeight="200.0" prefWidth="100.0" BorderPane.alignment="CENTER">
         <children>
            <Button mnemonicParsing="false" prefHeight="26.0" prefWidth="99.0" text="Menu 1" />
            <Button mnemonicParsing="false" prefHeight="26.0" prefWidth="99.0" text="Menu 2" />
            <Button mnemonicParsing="false" prefHeight="26.0" prefWidth="99.0" text="Menu 3" />
         </children>
      </VBox>
   </left>
   <bottom>
      <HBox prefHeight="42.0" prefWidth="600.0" BorderPane.alignment="CENTER">
         <children>
            <Hyperlink text="Link 1" />
            <Hyperlink text="Link 2" />
            <Hyperlink text="Link 3" />
         </children>
      </HBox>
   </bottom>
</BorderPane>

----

You can clearly see the regions of the `BorderPane` layout. The `<top>` region contains a label, while the `left` and `<bottom>` have container with their own layouts. In this example I have not used the `<center>` and `<right>` regions. Typically your program will be changing the content of the central area based on the user actions. For example, if the user clicks on the "Menu 1" button, JavaFX will generate a _clicked event_ and you'll show the content required for this selection. 

You'll learn how to process events in the next chapter. Now it's time to practice in working with combined layouts. 

=== Challenge Yourself

Using Scene Builder and a combination of the `BorderPane` and `GridPane` layout create GUI for the calculator that looks as on Figure 1.  Add the `TextField` to the `north` of the `BorderPane`. Then add a `GridPane` container to the `center` area - you'll add buttons to the grid. 

Most of the calculators have a display field on top and the buttons just below it. As you can see on Figure 1, the grid with buttons has four columns and six rows. The default `GridPane` contains two columns and three rows. You'll need to right-click on the grid and use the menus GridPane | Add Row Above and Add Column After to until you see a 4x6 grid as shown below.

[[FIG7-18]]
.The 4x6 GridPane in the center

Note that I set the `Padding` property to be 10 for all sides of the grid and the `Hgap` and `Vgap` to 5 (the gap between the cells).

Save the layout in the file _calculator.fxml_. The drop a Button in the top left cell of the grid. Set the `Margin` property to 5 for each side of the button - this is the distance between the button and cell borders. Drag the button's border to make it larger. This is what you should see:

[[FIG7-19]]
.The grid with one button 
image::images/fig_7_19.png[]

If you're curious how this button looks in the _calculator.fxml_, open this file in any text editor and note the section `<children>` that in my case looks like this:

[source, xml]
----
<children>
   <Button mnemonicParsing="false" prefHeight="37.0" prefWidth="132.0" text="Button">
      <GridPane.margin>
         <Insets bottom="5.0" left="5.0" right="5.0" top="5.0" />
      </GridPane.margin>
   </Button>  
</children>
----

There is no indication of the cell (0,0) because these are the default values for `GridPane.columnIndex` and `GridPane.rowIndex` properties. Now you need to replicate this button in other cells. You can use multiple Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V commands and then drag/drop the buttons into other cells. See how the content of the _calculator.fxml_ changes as you add more buttons. I find it faster copy/pasting the generated code in the FXML file than using Scene Builder for mass duplication.

Note that on Figure 1, the button with coordinates (0,5) spans two columns, and the button with coordinates (3,4) spans two rows. For these buttons you'll need to enter 2 as the row (or column) span, and select `MAX_VALUE` as maximum width (or height).  This is what you should see by now:

[[FIG7-20]]
.Replicated buttons 
image::images/fig_7_20.png[]

Change the text of each button to look as in Figure 1, and the layout is done.

Then create a new JavaFX project Calculator in IDEA and replace the generated _sample.fxml_ with _calculator.fxml_. Modify the generated class `Main` to use _calculator.fxml_. Rename the package from _sample_ to _mycalculator_. Set the size of the scene to be large enough to accommodate your design. This is how my class `Main` looks like:

[source, java]
----
public class Main extends Application {

  @Override
  public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception{
      Parent root = FXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource("calculator.fxml"));
      primaryStage.setTitle("My JavaFX Calculator");
      primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(root,650,600));
      primaryStage.show();
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
      launch(args);
  }
}
----

Run the `Main` program from IDEA to ensure that your calculator looks as expected.

Then create a CSS file to add some cool styling to the calculator's buttons. Save the CSS file in your IDEA project and modify the code of the `Main` class to use your CSS file similarly to how it was done in the section "Styling With CSS" above. Make your calculator look better than mine - it's not too difficult.

After completing this assignment your buttons won't work just yet. We'll make them work in the next chapter. My goal in this chapter was to introduce you to basic rules of designing JavaFX GUI with the help of Scene Builder.
