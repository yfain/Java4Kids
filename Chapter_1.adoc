== Chapter 1. Writing Your First Program

People communicate with each other using different languages.These days people often spend more time communicating with computers, smartphones and tablets than with each other. We casually say to each other, “I’ve installed a cool application that can do this and that”.  In other words, people use applications to communicate with computers. So someone has to write these applications. Those who write computer applications are called programmers or software developers. 

Programmers write applications like games, calculators, text editors using different programming languages. Without applications, computer, smartphone, or game console would have very limited use for most of the people.  Computing devices usually come with an Operational System  (QS) installed, e.g. Windows, Mac OS, iOS, Android etc. But imagine an iPhone that has no applications at all. Or a laptop that can only show the logo of Windows OS. Who would want  such a device?

Programmers create application using different programming languages like Java, Python, C++, JavaScript, C, and others. Some of the languages are good for produce small programs that require very little memory space and can be embedded in the computer chips. Some programming languages are great for programming Web applications that run inside the Web browsers. Some programming languages are great for running on the server and handling thousands of users’ requests.  There are languages are fine tuned for creating beautiful graphics. Similarly to human languages, programming languages have a set of words (a.k.a. keywords) that are allowed in the programs and the rules for using them (the syntax).  

In this book you’ll be learning the syntax of the Java programming language, which can be used for programming most of the application types. And for many many years the Java programming language has been one of the world’s most popular computer languages. In fact, as I write this, estimates are that there are close to 10 million professional Java programmers in the world. What makes it so popular?

For one thing, the same Java program can run on different devices: from desktop computers running Windows or MacOS to handheld devices like smartphones and tablets. As a matter of fact, Java programs don’t care what they’re running on, because they run inside a kind of virtual hardware called a virtual machine. We’ll talk about the Java Virtual Machine a bit later in this chapter. 

Java can be embedded in tiny microchips that control various home appliances or industrial devices like the ones that power smart homes where the heater or light can be programmed remotely from your phone. These Internet connected things can be programmed in Java.

Programming language can have some general characteristics, and we say that Java is an object-oriented language. Its program elements (called classes) represent objects from the real world. For example, you can create a class called `Car` and give it attributes that real cars have, like doors, wheels, a chassis, and so on. Next, you can create another class based on the `Car` class, like `Tesla`, with all the features of the `Car` class (doors, wheels, chassis) plus an electric motor.

And the software required to write Java is free. With so many million of professional Java programmers in the world, you’ll find lots of sample program online so if you’re run into a problem, you can either find the solution by searching or ask in one of the popular online forums like http://stackoverflow.com[Stack Overflow], and someone will probably answer your question!

But enough talk. Let’s start learning Java.


=== Installing Java on Your Computer

To start programming in Java you need to download Java Development Kit (JDK) from the company called Oracle, which leads most of the Java-related work and makes releases and updates of Java versions. The full name of the software to download is Java SE Development Kit. We'll download the  Java SE 8, which is the latest version at the time of this writing. Just visit this   
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Oracle's Web site]. Accept the license agreement and select the proper link depending on the Operational System (OS) installed on your computer. 

NOTE: While Java programmers need JDK installed, the users of your applications need to have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on their machines. JRE is included in JDK, but can be downloaded separately too.

[[FIG1-1]]
.Selecting the Java SE version

If you use Windows OS, download the file named jdk-8-windows-i586.exe. Since I work with Apple computers with Mac OS X, the file'jdk-8-macosx-x64.dmg' is my Java installer. Run your installer program, agree with all default answers (just press the button Next) and you're almost ready to go.
 
In Mac OS Java is installed in the folder _/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0.jdk_. On Windows computers it'll be installed under  
_c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_, where _c:_ is the name of your hard drive or SSD. If you use Mac OS, your installation is complete. 

==== For Windows Users Only

If you use Windows, you'll also need to add Java to the environment  variable `Path`. Click on the menu Start, Control Panel, System and search for _Environment Variables_. You'll see all system variables that exist in your OS As shown on the screenshot <<FIG1-4>>. If you have administrator's rights on your Windows PC, you can set user variables that will apply only when a certain user logs into your PC, or system variables that will apply to all users.


[[FIG1-4]]
.Windows OS - System Variables

Press the lower button _Edit_ - you need to add the _bin_ directory from your JDK at the beginning of the `Path` variable value. For example, add  _c:\Program Files\java\jdk1.8.0\bin;_ if this is where your JDK is installed:

Now the Windows installation of JDK is complete! I'm sure you're eager to start writing your first program now. Let's do it. 

=== Three Main Steps in Java Programming
 
If you have an idea _what_ to program, typically you'll need to perform the following three steps: 

. _Write_ the program in Java programming language and save it in a file.

. _Compile_ the program to translate it from Java language into a special _byte code_ that JVM understands.

. _Run_ the program.

==== Command Window

In this chapter we'll compile and run Hello World program in the Command window if you use Microsoft Windows or from Terminal application if you're on Mac OS.

In Windows to open the Command window click on the _Start_ menu and enter the letters _cmd_ in the field that read _Search programs and files_ . On Mac, open the Spotlight window by clicking on the looking glass icon at the top right corner of the screen, type the word Terminal and hit the button Return on the keyboard. 

First, create a folder name _practice_ by entering the following command:

_mkdir practice_

This will be the place, where we'll store all our Java programs. 

==== Step 1 – Write the Program

Starting from Chapter 2 will use a special application  called Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write, compile, and run programs. But to get a better understanding of how things work, let's use any plain text editor (e.g. Notepad, TextEdit et al.) to type in the code of our first Java program. Then you need to save the code in a text file with a name ending in _.java_. 

[[FIG1-8]]
.Typing the code 
image::images/fig_1_08.png[]

For example, if you want to write a program called `HelloWorld`, enter its code in a text editor. 
Here is the program that prints the words _Hello World!_ on your computer's screen:

[source, java] 
----
public class HelloWorld{

    public static void main(String[] args){

       System.out.println("Hello World!");
    
    }
}
----

Save the above code in this folder in the file named `HelloWorld.java` in folder _practice_. Keep in mind that you are not allowed to use blanks in Java file names. 

I’ll explain how this program works a little later in this chapter. For now just trust me – this program will print the words _Hello World_ on the screen in the step 3, which will happen pretty soon.

Programmers often use the words _the source code_ to refer to a program. So it's safe to say the we wrote the source code of the program Hello World. Unless you're experienced Java programmer, you can's just say if this program is written correctly. Let's proceed to Step 2 to find out.

==== Step 2 – Compile the Program

Now you need to start Java compiler asking to turn the source code of Hello World program into byte code that JRE  understands. The program named _javac_ is Java compiler, which is installed on your computer as a part of the JDK and is located in the _bin_ folder in your JDK.

[[FIG1-10]]
.Compiling the source code 
image::images/fig_1_10.png[width=400, height=550]


Change the directory to _practice_ with the command _cd practice_. If you never used the command _cd_ before, read  the online instructions on how to do it on http://www.wikihow.com/Change-Directories-in-Command-Prompt[Windows] or on http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line[Mac OS]. Now compile the program using the following command:

_javac HelloWorld.java_

You won’t see any confirmation message that your program `HelloWorld` has been compiled successfully. Having no messages means there is no problems. Type a command _dir_ on Windows or _ls_ on Mac and you'll see the list of files in folder _practice_. This is how it looks in my Terminal window:

[[FIG1-11]]
.HelloWorld compiled successfully
image::images/fig_1_11.png[]

First, I've entered the _pwd_ command to make sure I'm in the _practice_ folder. You should see there a new file named `HelloWorld.class`. This proves that your program has been successfully compiled. Your original file `HelloWorld.java` is also there, and you can modify this file later to print _Hello Mom_ or something else.

If the program has syntax errors, let’s say you forgot to type the last curly brace, Java compiler will print an error message. Now you’d need to fix the error, and recompile the program again. If you have several errors, you may need to repeat these actions more than once until the file `HelloWorld.class` is created.


==== Step 3 – Run the Program

Now let’s run the program. In the same Command or Terminal window enter the following:

_java HelloWorld_

After running this command, you'll see the text _Hello World!_ printed in the Terminal window as shown on <<FIG1-12>>. Have you noticed that this time you’ve used the program _java_ and not _javac_?  This is how you start JRE providing it the name of the application to run (HelloWorld in this case).

[[FIG1-12]]
.Running HelloWorld
image::images/fig_1_12.png[]

Keep in mind that Java does not treat capital and small letters the same, which means that if you named the program `HelloWorld` with a capital `H` and a capital `W`, do not try to start the program `helloworld` or `helloWorld` – the JRE will complain. The file name should match the class name too. Typically, each file of your application contains the code of one class even though you can keep the code of more than one class in the same file.  

Now let’s have some fun - try to guess how to modify the code of the program that prints Hello World.  I’ll explain how this program works in the next chapter, but still, try to guess what has to be done to say hello to your pet, friend or print your address. Go through all three steps to see if the program still works after your changes. If you don't have a pet, you can always say hello to my puppy - his name is Sammy. Are you up for the challenge to write a program that prints Hello Sammy! on the screen?

In the next chapter you'll learn how to write, compile and run your programs in a more convenient environment than just a text editor and a Command window.
